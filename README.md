# VCVLyricInserter
This is a program that inserts VCV lyrics into an UST from either hiragana CV or romaji CV input.

## Installation
Install this plugin the way you would install any other plugin: download the folder located at "VCVLyricInserter/UTAU VCVLyricInserter plugin/Debug/net5.0/" within this repository and place it in your UTAU plugins directory. 

## Running the program
Open UTAU and select the range of notes you would like to edit the lyrics for. Run the program by going to Tools -> Plug-Ins -> VCV Lyric Inserter. Enter your lyrics, but be sure you follow the proper formatting (use either hiragana or romaji, not both!). Your lyrics will now be inserted into your file. 

Keep in mind that, currently, any note that acts as a rest but does not contain only the character "r" or "R" will be treated as a note wherein the lyric can be changed. I plan on changing this!
